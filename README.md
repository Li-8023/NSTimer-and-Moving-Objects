# NSTimer-and-Moving-Objects
+ In this lab, you will be developing a simple game called “apple picking monkey”. The timer and the
moving images example are storyboard based. 
+ Monkey can move left, right, up, down by clicking respective arrows. Once the monkey collects an apple, the apple will disappear. Also, as
application starts, counter will start a stopwatch that keeps counting as time elapsed. If the monkey can pick all apples within 10 seconds, declare the monkey as the winner.
